### Hi there 👋
This is a tomb for source code, a place where I store small projects and code snippets. Therefore the source code may well be incomplete or not executable. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on some internal projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and flutter (dart)

### Skills
My programming languages and frameworks I like to use and in which I always want to improve my skills.
